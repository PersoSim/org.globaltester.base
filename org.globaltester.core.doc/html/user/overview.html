	<h1>GlobalTester overview</h1>
	<p>GlobalTester offers an integrated test environment with a
		holistic approach to testing that covers test specification, test
		execution, test evaluation, detailed failure analysis and reporting.
		All conformity tests can be customized and extended by user-defined
		tests through GlobalPlatform scripting. Customers can either develop
		customized test suites on their own or ask the HJP experts to develop
		test suites for them.</p>

	<p>The module Test Specification allows users to implement test
		suites based on existing test specifications. It also enables
		customers to write and generate customized test specifications based
		on the latest XML scheme by the German Federal Office for Information
		Security (BSI). Our one-step approach to test specification and
		execution allows users to run test suites or single test cases
		directly from Test Specification.</p>
	<p>The module Test Runner allows users to execute tests, create
		test reports and view and evaluate test results. Several traceability
		functions (e.g., repeating past test runs) help users during product
		development and during failure analysis and elimination.</p>
	<p>HJP Consulting offers standard and customized test suites to
		test the application layer of eID cards, e-passports and terminals on
		a contractual basis. All of our conformity test suites are based on
		JavaScript, GlobalPlatform Scripting language and XML.</p>
