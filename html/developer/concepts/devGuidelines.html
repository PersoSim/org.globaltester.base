			<li>Private fields in a class can be used by this class directly, without using a corresponding getter/setter</li>
		</ul>

	<p>TODO - Default values in plug-in meta-data (HJP Consulting GmbH
		for commercial, GlobalTester Community for community plug-ins???)</p>
	<p>TODO - when to start a new plug-in and when to add to an existing
		one</p>
	<h2>Java and Eclipse Versions</h2>
	<p>
	GlobalTester 3 is supposed to be able to be used with the current and preceding Eclipse and Java version.
	Right now Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) and Java 1.6 should be used. Any new plug-ins, Bundles, Fragments, etc. should satisfy this condition.
	Dependencies to Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) or Java 7 should be avoided.
	</p>
	
	<h2>SVN Repository Structure</h2>
	<p>
	The directory &quot;Trunk&quot; should be underneath the projects.
	This way ensures that versions can be tagged for the single plug-ins and no ambiguous tags can appear in the whole repository.
	If you share a project, please make sure you follow the intructions in our <a href=" ../tasks/shareProjectOrFragment.html">help tasks</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Launch Configurations</h2>
	<p>
	The launch configuration &quot;GT3_RCP&quot; should exactly represent the state, which is in accordance with the completed Jenkins build.
	If you want to use your own plug-ins, please use the launch configuration &quot;GT3_SDK&quot;. This one enables all plug-ins in your workspace.
	Your own plug-in will be integrated to the product by adding it to the according feature. 
	</p>
