	<h1>Get the code</h1>
	<p>All required source code is held in the central GlobalTester
		Subversion repository. Access to this repository is controlled by HJP
		Consulting and you may get an account by sending a request via eMail
		to support@hjp-consulting.com.</p>
	<p>
		The central repository currently can be accessed using the following
		URL <a href="http://subversion/repo/globaltester">http://subversion/repo/globaltester</a>.
		This can currently only be accesed from within the HJP private network
		a public access for this is planned and will be listed here when
		available.
	</p>
	<p>After you have configured your access to the server (using your
		credentials) you will see a wide variety of plugin/feature projects.
		Each of them represents a small part of the available GlobalTester
		functionality. But don't be afraid you won't need to handle this
		complexity manually.</p>
	<p>Just checkout the project com.hjp.globaltester.releng to your
		workspace. This is the main release engineering project and it defines
		several Buckminster CQUERYs and MSPECs that can be used to populate
		your workspace with all you need (almost) automatically. To populate
		your workspace with the components you need select the according
		CQUERY or MSPEC, right-click it, and select "Buckminster > Import...".
		This will fire up a wizard that guides you through the process.</p>
	<p>The first thing you need to get into your workspace is the
		target platform. This ensures that you develop against the correct
		target definition and makes sure that no non-GlobalTester components
		get materialized inside your workspace instead of inside the
		targetplatform. To get it import the targetplatform.mspec using
		Buckminster. Double-check that you import the MSPEC not the CQUERY,
		this ensures that your targetplatform is setup accordingly to the
		automated build infrastructure. Please make sure that this is the
		first target you materialize before any other CQUERY. Be aware this
		will take a while and you will see only the Eclipse-Feature-Project
		org.globaltester.targetplatform materialize in the workspace while the
		plugins that make up your target platform will be materialized to a
		hidden directory. (The hidden directory is named within the
		targetplatform.mspec so you can take a look at what happend, but
		please do not change anything here, as it most probalby will break the
		build infrastructure).</p>
	<p>In order to get the source of plug-ins to work with you will
		need to materialize at least one other CQUERY into your workspace.
		Below you will find a list of interesting Buckminster targets and what
		they are used for. Depending on your subscription you might not be
		able to import all of them (although you can see the Buckminster
		definitions).</p>
